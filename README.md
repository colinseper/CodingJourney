## Coding Journey üßó
Below I plan to list all the coding courses I've taken, projects I've completed, and basically everything I did (including college courses) until I become a full-stack software engineer, just in case anyone wants course recommendations or ideas on classes to take and at what point. Most of the resources I use will be free, but inevitably some courses cannot be avaible online (college classes) or I may spend money on a course if I feel it is worth it (I will specify if it was paid for). I will give a nod to projects I completed here, but descriptions/code will be in one of my repositories.
### ‚ùóQuick Note‚ùó
Don't try and compare yourself to my journey and the way I tried to progress. Pick and choose what you think will work and help you, because I'm not you so I don't know what you're interested in, what you're good at or where you are in your journey. If you happen to like all the courses I took, don't not take the courses because I said not to follow my journey, just remeber to take what I did as a possible guidline and feel free to adjust it whenever you need. Also, you won't be able to become a good programmer if you don't balance other things in your life. So go spend time with family and friends, get good sleep and make sure to spend time improving your physical and mental health üòä. Good Luck!

### ‚ú® Journey Outline ‚ú®

‚óè <a href ="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0" target="blank"> Harvard CS50x</a>(C): No prior programming experience, difficult but helped me immensely both as an introduction to programming and as a confirmation of wanting to become a software engineer. Great course for anyone who has no prior background and wants to learn a bit about learning to code. Created a full-stack webpage for my final project (CS50_Final_Project Repository).

‚óè Intro to Programming with MATLAB(C - College): Review of general principles and introduction to MATLAB language. Created Snake game for final project, viewable in repositories(Intro_to_MATLAB_Final_Project).

‚óè Statistics with R(C - College): Basic introduction to R and Statistics.

‚óè <a href ="https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-java-from-scratch" target ="blank">Learn Java from Scratch</a>(C): Fairly good intro to Java course, although at some points found it hard to follow (Used Youtube Videos from BroCode to help my understanding). Make sure to follow along coding either with VScode or another resource. At later points the given code solutions were a bit cruddy, with some being solutions soley to solve the test cases rather than the problems asked (always try and find a better solution!). However, overall good intro course and great free resource.

‚óè Personal Project - Quizzer: a java application (through the command line) to help me review my programming notes specifically, but also other school notes (Quizzer Repository). 

‚óè Introduction to Object Oriented Programming with Python(C - College): Basic introduction to Python.

‚óè <a href= "https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1" target ="blank"> Algorithms I</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2"> Algorithms II </a>(C) - (I only completed Week 1-2, and 4 from Algorithms II): Amazing course teaching data structures and algorithms. I didn't complete any projects from Weeks 1-2 and Week 4 from Algorithms II due to my computer breaking while I was studying abroad... However, I might go back and do them later, but I'm planning on an Algorithm/Data Structure visualizer at some point to help me study so I might not. I was recommended to only do Weeks 1-2 and Week 4 of Algorithms II from PowerCouple on YouTube because they said that the others weren't very helpful for coding interviews, and although I love algorithms coding interviews were my main focus for this course. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and it taught me to learn to love algorithms, however are definitely a few pieces of advice I would give to someone taking this course for the first time. 1) DON'T READ THE TEXTBOOK FIRST PLEASE!!! I think the textbook is helpful and can give some helpful explanations not found in the videos but quite frankly reading the chapters before watching the videos is a waste of time because Segwick's lectures are just that good. I'd recommend jumping straight into the videos and looking over the textbook after to add to notes or provide clarifications. It will save you an incredible amount of time and if you at least skim the textbook it won't hinder you at all. 2) APPLY IT!! Do the problem sets or leetcode questions during/after the course. For the majority of the course I was doing problem sets, but at the end (when my computer broke) while interview prepping I did leetcode and I think this really helped my understanding of these algorithms. I think I'm pretty good at applying a general understanding of theory to code, but theory doesn't account for time, pressure, or any extraneous factors that could affect you while you're interviewing. So I definitely would say to do leetcode questions after at a minimum (I recommend Neetcode or Leetcode 150), but I think the problem sets can be helpful to apply your knowledge too. 3) Have a plan. When doing the Algorithms I problem sets I always thought of a solution before coding it out. This can help with your mindset and approach to problem-solving. Even now I sometimes know exactly what data structure or algorithm to use, but I can't quite apply it whether due to time, pressure, or just tunnel vision. Therefore, I think building up your pre-planning and understanding before you could is really important because although it might be annoying for the easy problems it will exponentially make you a better programmer when push comes to shove. Overall, I would say Algorithms I and II are amazing courses and definitely worth taking in part. If nothing else, just watch the videos from Sedgwick and take notes and it'll still be worth it.
