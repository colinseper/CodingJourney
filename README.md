## Coding Journey üßó
Below I plan to list all the coding courses I've taken, projects I've completed, and basically everything I did (including college courses) until I become a full-stack software engineer, just in case anyone wants course recommendations or ideas on classes to take and at what point. Most of the resources I use will be free, but inevitably some courses cannot be avaible online (college classes) or I may spend money on a course if I feel it is worth it (I will specify if it was paid for). I will give a nod to projects I completed here, but descriptions/code will be in one of my repositories.
### ‚ùóQuick Note‚ùó
Don't try and compare yourself to my journey and the way I tried to progress. Pick and choose what you think will work and help you, because I'm not you so I don't know what you're interested in, what you're good at or where you are in your journey. If you happen to like all the courses I took, don't not take the courses because I said not to follow my journey, just remeber to take what I did as a possible guidline and feel free to adjust it whenever you need. Also, you won't be able to become a good programmer if you don't balance other things in your life. So go spend time with family and friends, get good sleep and make sure to spend time improving your physical and mental health üòä. Good Luck!

### ‚ú® Journey Outline ‚ú®

‚óè <a href ="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0" target="blank"> Harvard CS50x</a>(C): No prior programming experience, difficult but helped me immensely both as an introduction to programming and as a confirmation of wanting to become a software engineer. Great course for anyone who has no prior background and wants to learn a bit about learning to code. Created a full-stack webpage for my final project (CS50_Final_Project Repository).

‚óè Intro to Programming with MATLAB(C - College): Review of general principles and introduction to MATLAB language. Created Snake game for final project, viewable in repositories(Intro_to_MATLAB_Final_Project).

‚óè Statistics with R(C - College): Basic introduction to R and Statistics.

‚óè <a href ="https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-java-from-scratch" target ="blank">Learn Java from Scratch</a>(C): Fairly good intro to Java course, although at some points found it hard to follow (Used Youtube Videos from BroCode to help my understanding). Make sure to follow along coding either with VScode or another resource. At later points the given code solutions were a bit cruddy, with some being solutions soley to solve the test cases rather than the problems asked (always try and find a better solution!). However, overall good intro course and great free resource.

‚óè Personal Project - Quizzer: a java application (through the command line) to help me review my programming notes specifically, but also other school notes (Quizzer Repository). 

‚óè Introduction to Object Oriented Programming with Python(C): Basic introduction to Python.
